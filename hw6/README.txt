     -Total density
In the timedesign summary in the hold time file it says that the density is.

Density: 97.593%


     -Worst case setup time in design and its associated path 

In the setup_time_.slk file this is the woarst setup time.

# Format: clock  timeReq  slackR/slackF  setupR/setupF  instName/pinName   # cycle(s)
clk(R)->clk(R)	8.990    */8.855         */1.000         LED    1





     -Worst case hold time in the design and its associated path

In the cadence_holdtime file I created in reports it says that the worst case hold time is 

# Format: clock  timeReq  slackR/slackF  holdR/holdF  instName/pinName   # cycle(s)
clk(R)->clk(R)	-2.174   */3.409         */2.194         counter_sm0/restart_reg/D    1





     -Any physical violations in your design
