Hi Erin, my state machines and everything should be in this zip, I emailed Joe that I am using this assignment as my late pass. I had finished this assignment last week, I just was spending some time of my state diagrams to make them look nice. You can look at the diagram and the two list files, sensor.list and Joe's golden results to see that my waveform is off by a few clocks, Joe said that this was fine though. 

Thanks
Eddie.
