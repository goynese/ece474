	-Total gate count and area

Since a nand gate has area 5.443 um^2. I can take the total area 14894.983318 then divide by
the 5.443, giving me the total number of gates to be 2736. 




	-Worst case setup time in design and its associated path 

The worst case setup time in my delay.txt in reports was 8.53 us. Its path was

  Startpoint: counter_sm0/restart_mem_reg
              (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)

  Endpoint: fifo0/byte1_reg[1]
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk_mem)


	


	-Worst case hold time in the design and its associated path
	
The worst case hold time in my hold.txt file was 0.33 us.   

Startpoint: fifo0/byte1_reg[1]
              (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk_mem)

Endpoint: fifo0/byte1_reg[1]
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk_mem)

	




	-Number of latches found if any and how you got rid of them if any
	
When searching the hierchy file I didn't find any latches. YAY :)
